Pallets have their own discrete logics that are fired when any events are taking place in a block. The feature and functional logic of theses event transactions can be modified accordingly to developers need.This pallet verifies the proof of exsistence of the file by creating hash and storing it in the blockchain.
To add the pallet one have to create config, events, errors, storage, hooks and the most important one the storage.The name of the modules are self-explainatory.I have connected this pallet with substrate-frontend-template and verified the working.
