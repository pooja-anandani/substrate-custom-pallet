Pallets Have their own discrete logics. The features and functional logic of transaction can be modified accordingly to developers need.
This pallet verifies the proof of exsistence of the file by creating hash and storing it in the blockchain.
To add the pallet one have to create config, events, errors, storage, hooks and the most important one the storage.
I have connected this pallet with substrate-frontend-template and verified the working of it.
